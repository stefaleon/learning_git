    Step: Add username to Git
    
    Add your GitHub username to your Git configuration, which will be needed in order to verify the upcoming challenges. Save it exactly as you created it on GitHub â€” capitalize where capitalized, and remember you don't need to enter the "<" and ">" .
    
    Add your GitHub username to your configuration:
    $ git config --global user.username <USerNamE>
